## Prerequisites

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the Page by modifying `app/Page.tsx`. The Page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.




## Overview

DeCenter AI functions as a PaaS infrastructure, empowering machine learning engineers to expedite and make the training
of AI models more cost-effective through decentralized parallel training methods.

The core objective of DeCenter AI is to democratize and decentralize AI model training. By offering a distributed
training platform, it allows data scientists, machine learning engineers, researchers, and AI specialists to
collaboratively contribute to the training of AI models. Structured around a distributed parallel training mechanism,
DeCenter AI has been designed to facilitate the training of various ML and DL models in a significantly reduced time
frame and cost compared to the current norms.
Our platform incorporates a built-in incentive system, fueled by DCEN Tokens. This system not only rewards contributors
and participants but also encourages them to undertake tasks such as reviewing, testing, and rating AI models.
